## FAQ

* Q1ÔºöHow to install the publishing tool plugin? Where can I find his entrance after installation?

  A1ÔºöFind **`Bazaar->Plugins->Publishing Tools`** to download and enable.

  The installation process requires no further action. This is no different from the download and installation of other plugins.

  After the installation is complete, find the ‚úàÔ∏è icon on the top right toolbar, click the menu, and follow the corresponding instructions to use it.


* Q2ÔºöAfter installing the publishing tool plugin, do I still need to install the widget?

  A2Ôºö**unnecessary.**

  The plugin version contains all the functions of the widget version.

* Q3: I am not used to the new version of the operation and want to continue to use the previous widget, can I?

  A3:**Yes but not recommended.**

  **We strongly recommend that you use the plug-in version directly, because the plug-in version will be the main version for long-term maintenance in the future, and the hanger version has been deprecated only as a fix for problems and compatible with historical users.**


* Q4ÔºöI used to use `Custom JS Fragment` or add `WidgetInvoke` directly, do I still need to download the plugin now?

  A4Ôºö**Optional.** But we highly recommended to remove JS snippets and widgets to download the plugin version.

  If you don't want to use the plugin version, you don't need to download it, just use the original `custom JS fragment` or add `widget` to continue using.

  If you want to use the plugin version, then we strongly recommend that you delete the previously added `custom JS snippets` and `widgets`, download the plugin version directly, and enable it. No other additional action is required.


* Q5ÔºöIs it possible to migrate my historical configuration data items to the plugin?

* A5Ôºö**Yes.**

  Please go to `Settings->Import and Export->Import the historical data of the widget version. ` Operation.

  Note: The widget version configuration data import only supports `sy-p-cfg-v0.8.0.json` and `picgo.json`.


* Q6ÔºöWhat should I do if the platform I need to publish is not provided by the publishing tool?
